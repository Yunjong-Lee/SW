### What is Machine Learning?
- Machine Learning?
  - Samuel : the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  
  - Tom Mitchell : A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

- Example: playing checkers.  
  - E = the experience of playing many games of checkers  
  - T = the task of playing checkers.  
  - P = the probability that the program will win the next game.  
  
- In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
  - Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.



#### [카메라 캘리브레이션의 이해와 Python 실습](https://gaussian37.github.io/vision-concept-calibration/)

* world space를 image plane으로 변환: world space와 image plane 관계 (변환 행렬)  
* center of projection, focal length

* extrinsic : world coordinate system → camera coordinate system으로 좌표계를 변환할 때 사용하는 행렬(카메라가 실제 장착된 위치 등의 환경과 관련)  
  ※ world coordinate system: world space의 좌표계  
  ※ camera coordinate system: X, Y, Z 축으로 표현한 좌표계  
  - world space 상에서 카메라의 방향과 위치를 알아야 함  

* intrinsic : camera coordinate system의 점들을 image plane의 좌표로 변환하는 행렬
