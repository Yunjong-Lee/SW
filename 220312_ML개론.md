### What is Machine Learning?
- Machine Learning?
  - Samuel : the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  
  - Tom Mitchell : A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

- Example: playing checkers.  
  - E = the experience of playing many games of checkers  
  - T = the task of playing checkers.  
  - P = the probability that the program will win the next game.  
  
- In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
  - Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.
